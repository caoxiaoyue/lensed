Building Lensed
===============

Lensed is a standard Makefile project. On a system where all dependencies can
be resolved automatically, it should be enough to call

```sh
$ make
```

from the root folder of Lensed to build the program. If this fails, further
[configuration](#configuration) might be necessary.

After compilation has finished, a quick check of

```sh
$ bin/lensed --version
lensed X.Y.Z
```

should display the correct version number of Lensed.


Configuration
-------------

There are a number of configuration variables that can be passed to Lensed's
build system. They are given in the form of `NAME="value"` pairs to `make`,
e.g.

```sh
$ make EXTRA_LIBS="-L/opt/OpenBLAS/lib -lopenblas"
```

The following variables can be passed to Lensed:

| Name                    | Description                                       |
|-------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| `CFITSIO_DIR`           | path to a local CFITSIO build                     |
| `CFITSIO_INCLUDE_DIR`   | path to `fitsio.h`                                |
| `CFITSIO_LIB_DIR`       | path to `libcfitsio`                              |
| `CFITSIO_LIB`           | CFITSIO library (e.g. `-lcfitsio`)                |
| `MULTINEST_DIR`         | path to a local MultiNest CMake build             |
| `MULTINEST_INCLUDE_DIR` | path to `multinest.h`                             |
| `MULTINEST_LIB_DIR`     | path to the MultiNest library                     |
| `MULTINEST_LIB`         | MultiNest library (e.g. `-lmultinest`, `-lnest3`) |
| `OPENCL_DIR`            | path to the OpenCL implementation                 |
| `OPENCL_INCLUDE_DIR`    | path to the `CL/cl.h` header                      |
| `OPENCL_LIB_DIR`        | path to the OpenCL library                        |
| `OPENCL_LIB`            | OpenCL runtime library (e.g. `-lOpenCL`)          |
| `EXTRA_LIBS`            | additional libraries and linker flags             |

The values of these variables are cached in a file `build/cache.mk` and do not
have to be repeated on subsequent calls to make. The contents of the cache can
be shown using `make show-cache`:

```sh
$ make show-cache
# cached settings for make
CFITSIO_INCLUDE_DIR = 
CFITSIO_LIB_DIR = 
CFITSIO_LIB = -lcfitsio
MULTINEST_INCLUDE_DIR = 
MULTINEST_LIB_DIR = 
MULTINEST_LIB = -lmultinest
OPENCL_INCLUDE_DIR = 
OPENCL_LIB_DIR = 
OPENCL_LIB = -framework OpenCL
EXTRA_LIBS = 
```

Please note that the `_INCLUDE_DIR` and `_LIB_DIR` variables override the value
of the corresponding `_DIR` variable, so either the former two or the latter
should be set.

The following sections contain further details on configuring the individual
components of Lensed.


CFITSIO
-------

If CFITSIO has been built from source, the path to the source folder can be
given to Lensed using the `CFITSIO_DIR` variable.

```sh
$ make CFITSIO_DIR="$HOME/cfitsio"
```

This sets both `CFITSIO_INCLUDE_DIR` and `CFITSIO_LIB_DIR` to `CFITSIO_DIR`, as
this is where `fitsio.h` and `libcfitsio` reside by default.

Alternatively, `CFITSIO_INCLUDE_DIR` and `CFITSIO_LIB_DIR` can be explicitly
specified.

```sh
$ make CFITSIO_INCLUDE_DIR="$HOME/headers" CFITSIO_LIB_DIR="$HOME/libraries"
```

The default CFITSIO library be linked is `-lcfitsio`. This can be overridden
using the `CFITSIO_LIB` flag, either giving `-l<name>` linker flag or the full
path to the library.

```sh
$ make CFITSIO_LIB="$HOME/libraries/my-cfitsio-lib.a"
```


MultiNest
---------

In case MultiNest was built using CMake, it is usually enough to pass the path
to the source folder to make using the `MULTINEST_DIR` variable.

```sh
$ make MULTINEST_DIR="$HOME/multinest"
```

This sets the variables `MULTINEST_INCLUDE_DIR` to `$MULTINEST_DIR/include` and
`MULTINEST_LIB_DIR` to `$MULTINEST_DIR/lib`, as these are the default paths to
`multinest.h` and `libmultinest`, respectively.

Alternatively, the variables `MULTINEST_INCLUDE_DIR` and `MULTINEST_LIB_DIR`
can be set explicitly to the paths containing the required files.

```sh
$ make MULTINEST_INCLUDE_DIR="$HOME/headers" MULTINEST_LIB_DIR="$HOME/libraries"
```

The name of the MultiNest library that will be linked is `MULTINEST_LIB`, which
defaults to `-lmultinest` as generated by the CMake version. This can be set to
a linker flag `-l<name>` or a full library path.

```sh
$ make MULTINEST_LIB="$HOME/multinest/my-multinest-lib.a"
```

**For the Makefile version** of MultiNest, the correct settings are

```sh
$ make MULTINEST_INCLUDE_DIR="/path/to/multinest/example_eggbox_C" \
       MULTINEST_LIB_DIR="/path/to/multinest" \
       MULTINEST_LIB="-lnest3"
```


OpenCL
------

In order to build Lensed, the compiler needs the OpenCL header `CL/cl.h` and
the OpenCL runtime library.

If these are provided by a vendor SDK, it is usually enough to point the
`OPENCL_DIR` variable to the root of the SDK:

```sh
$ make OPENCL_DIR="/usr/local/cuda"
```

This sets the variables `OPENCL_INCLUDE_DIR` and `OPENCL_LIB_DIR` to default
values of `$OPENCL_DIR/include` and `$OPENCL_DIR/lib`, respectively.

Alternatively, it is possible to set `OPENCL_INCLUDE_DIR` and `OPENCL_LIB_DIR`
manually to the paths containing `CL/cl.h` (note the subfolder) and the OpenCL
library (usually `libOpenCL`), respectively.

```sh
$ make OPENCL_INCLUDE_DIR="$HOME/headers" OPENCL_LIB_DIR="$HOME/libraries"
```

The name of the OpenCL runtime library can be set by the `OPENCL_LIB` variable.
This can be a linker flag such as `-lOpenCL` or an explicit path to a library.

```sh
$ make OPENCL_LIB="$HOME/experimental-driver/libOpenCL.so"
```

**Mac OS X**: Please note that Mac OS X comes with a framework containing the
OpenCL headers and library. It is not necessary to change the OpenCL settings.

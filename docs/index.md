Lensed Documentation
====================

This is the documentation for Lensed, a scientific tool to model gravitational
lenses from observations of strong lensing. For more information about Lensed,
please see the [website](http://glenco.github.io/lensed/), where you will also
find a link to the paper, and the [project](https://github.com/glenco/lensed),
where the source code and discussions are hosted.

These pages try to cover all aspects of working with Lensed: from the initial
setup of the code, over general information on running Lensed to analyse and
reconstruct observations, to more specific information about the provided lens
and source objects and instructions for implementing your own models. Please
refer to the menu structure on the left to find specific information, or use
